# MyOS - my operating system

### About
MyOS is a project I started for fun and now it has a few commands and password protection!

The OS uses the **M**aster **B**oot **R**ecord (MBR) standard. It is 16 bit and runs on x86 devices.

The kernel relies heavily on BIOS interrupts.

### To-Do List

- add a license for the code
- add command to execute scripts (that use shell commands)
- add a way to print numbers and do more math
